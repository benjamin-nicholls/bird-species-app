# Mobile Application for Bird Species Classifier
Powered by a Vision Transformer from Hugging Face.

This project was created for my undergraduate dissertation.

It uses 'Birds 525 Species' dataset 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species). This dataset 
is often updated to include more species.

The vision transformer classification model is trained using a Hugging 
Face wrapper called HugsVision.

The mobile application is written in React Native using Expo.

The server backend uses Flask.
